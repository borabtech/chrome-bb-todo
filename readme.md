# 🚀 Extendo: Expand Your Productivity

**Extendo**, is a browser extension developed to solve the focus challenges of modern web users. Going beyond a simple to-do list, it provides a comprehensive "information hub" that lives right in your side panel.

## 💡 Why Extendo?

Most note-taking applications force users to navigate away from their current tab. Extendo integrates directly into your workflow by utilizing the Chrome Side Panel. Whether you are reading an article, watching a video, or writing code, it allows you to take rich-content notes without ever leaving the page.

## 🛠 Business Logic & Core Values

1. **Local-First Security:** User data is private. No registration or cloud synchronization is required. All data remains entirely within the user's own browser.
2. **Hierarchical Detailing:** To prevent clutter in the list view, only titles are displayed. Each task features a massive "Detail Panel" that can host videos, images, and rich formatted text.
3. **Flexible Status Management:** Tasks are not limited to just "done/undone"; they are managed through professional workflow statuses such as "Waiting," "In Progress," and "Closed."
4. **Portability:** Users are never locked into the platform. With a single click, all data can be exported as a JSON file or imported back into the extension.
