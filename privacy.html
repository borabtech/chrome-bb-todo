            <p>Extendo is committed to ensuring your privacy. This extension is designed with a "local-first" approach.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Collection: Extendo does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All your notes, todos, and descriptions are stored locally on your device using Google Chrome's local storage.</li>
                
                <li>Data Sharing: Since we do not collect any data, we do not share any data with third parties.</li>
                
                <li>User Control: All data is managed by the user. Deleting a todo or removing the extension will permanently delete the stored data from your local device.</li>
                
                <li>Permissions: The extension requires storage permission to save your notes and sidePanel to provide a seamless user experience.</li>
